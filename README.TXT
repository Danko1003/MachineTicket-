Project: better-ticket-machine
Authors: David Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling
   Pearson Education

It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate conditional statements.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.
Test

Answer part:
1 x
2 Money inserted - Ticket price
3 The Money inseted - Ticket price is the refund value
4 x
5 The price indicated on the tickets changes

7 The code breaks it we change put public like this: (class public), instead of (public class)
8 It does not break the code if we remove public
9 YOU CANNOT REMOVE THE WORD CLASS FROM THE CPODE CAUSE YOU CANNOT IDENTIFIE A BLUEPRINT AS BLUEPRINT WITHOUT SAYING IT IS A BLUEPRINT
10 
11 a) same function name as its class, 
   b)
12 int, Student, Server
13 alive,tutor, game
14 class names are what comes after the class types.
15 It did not really change,the function ordering are shown in alphabeteic order.
16 Yes, it is necessary to put a semicolon at the end of code that set value,call function( basically all code that is not defining a function or class.
17 public int status;
18 Student class
19 2, it is String and double(doubles are numbers with decimals)
20 
21 public Pet(String petsName) {
      this.petsName = petsName;
}
22 
public class Date{
    public String month;
    public int day;
    public int year;
    public Date(String month, int day, int year){
        this.month = month;
        this.day = day;
        this.year = year;
    }
}
23 one returns the price variable and the other returns the balance variables

24 What is left of the total amount of money that was given to the ticket machine?
25 You do not need to change the name of the return because in this situation, you did not change the name of the variable, only the name of the function was changed.
26 The total of money the machine has accumulated from selling tickets.
27 will not consider the line of code as a code statement. (not a statement)
28 one returns a value the other simply activates a println function without returning a Type.
29 They do not have return statements because they are made to activate certain functions and not to return a type.
30 first call will show 0,the second call will show the amount of money inserted into the machine.
31 
{
    score += points;
}
32 yes, it is a mutator cause it modifies the value of a variable.

33 
{
    price -= amount;
    
}
34 public int age;
{
    public void age(int currentAge){
       age = currentage;
       
    }
    
}
35 private boolean alive;
{
    public void setLivingStatus(boolean isalive){
        alive = isalive;
    }
}
36 The total price will be set to 0 cause the price was 0 before so it sets it's price to it's price which was 0.
